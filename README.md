![firstscreenshot](./assets/ss1.png)

Application deploys with no city data stored. The user must first input the city they'd like to search before any data will populate on the page. The cities added to the list remain on page refresh. 

The data on the main page contains a variety of useful weather information, and a 5 day forecast.

The website is designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive.
